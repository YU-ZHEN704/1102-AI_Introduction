Write a Q-learning agent, which does very little on construction, but 
instead learns by trial and error from interactions with the environment through 
its update(state, action, nextState, reward) method. A stub of a Q
learner is specified in QLearningAgent in qlearningAgents.py, and you can 
select it with the option '-a q'. For this question, you must implement 
the update, computeValueFromQValues, getQValue, 
and computeActionFromQValues methods.
